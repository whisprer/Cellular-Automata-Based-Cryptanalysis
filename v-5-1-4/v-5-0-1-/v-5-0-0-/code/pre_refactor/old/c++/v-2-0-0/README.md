# CACA - Cellular Automata CryptAnalysis

CACA (Cellular Automata-based Cryptanalysis) is a project that explores the use of Cellular Automata (CA) techniques for potential cryptanalysis applications. The project adapts methods from image denoising research to analyze patterns in encrypted data.

## Overview

This project combines two main approaches:
1. NIST Statistical Test Suite (NIST STS) for evaluating randomness in bit sequences
2. Cellular Automata (CA) for pattern detection and noise filtering

The idea is to test whether CA-based denoising techniques that are effective for recovering signals from noisy images (particularly salt-and-pepper noise in biometric applications) can also reveal patterns or weaknesses in encrypted data.

## Features

- Implementation of the NIST STS randomness testing suite (15 statistical tests)
- Various random number generator implementations for comparison
- Cellular Automata processing with Moore neighborhood rules
- Performance-optimized C++ implementation with multi-threading support

## Statistical Tests Included

- Frequency (Monobit) Test
- Block Frequency Test
- Runs Test
- Longest Run Test
- Binary Matrix Rank Test
- Discrete Fourier Transform (Spectral) Test
- Non-overlapping Template Matching Test
- Overlapping Template Matching Test
- Maurer's Universal Statistical Test
- Linear Complexity Test
- Serial Test
- Approximate Entropy Test
- Cumulative Sums Test
- Random Excursions Test
- Random Excursions Variant Test

## Random Number Generators

- Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
- Blum-Blum-Shub (BBS)
- SHA-1 based generator
- XOR shift register
- Quadratic Congruential (two types)
- Cubic Congruential
- Micali-Schnorr
- Modular Exponentiation

## Theoretical Basis

The project is inspired by research showing that mirrored CA with Moore neighborhood (8-cell) rules can effectively denoise images, particularly salt-and-pepper noise in biometric applications. These CA techniques have shown superior performance compared to traditional methods, achieving better PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and SSIM (Structural Similarity) metrics.

The hypothesis is that if encryption has minor imperfections, CA-based filtering might help reveal underlying patterns or biases.

# Performance Considerations

Multi-threading support
Configurable test parameters
Efficient big number arithmetic implementations
