Cellular Automata-Based Cryptanalysis: A Novel Non-Invasive Approach to Encryption Vulnerability Detection
Abstract
Contemporary cryptographic systems demand robust mechanisms for assessing encryption integrity without compromising data confidentiality. This research introduces Cellular Automata CryptAnalysis (CACA), an innovative methodology leveraging cellular automata (CA) principles to systematically evaluate encryption implementations' structural integrity and potential vulnerabilities. By applying sophisticated CA rules across diverse encryption schemes, we demonstrate a non-invasive technique capable of distinguishing encryption quality, detecting implementation flaws, and providing nuanced insights into cryptographic robustness without decryption.
