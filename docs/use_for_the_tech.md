## Why Make This Library? ##

I was bored, it was a weekend, not much else going on...

A C++ library with capabilities cfrenin the realm of analysing encrypted files and although not decrypting them, at least being able to say whether they are encrypted, how well and specify what kind of flaws there are in the encryption when present, could serve several interesting purposes, both in industry and research. Here are some examples:

## Security Auditing & Compliance:
It can scan files in an enterprise or government environment to ensure that encryption practices meet current security standards. For example, it might flag files using outdated algorithms like DES or RC4, or ones using insecure modes like ECB, alerting administrators before any potential data breach occurs.

## Digital Forensics:
Investigators can quickly determine if a file is encrypted and, importantly, identify weaknesses in the encryption scheme. This is helpful when analyzing data from compromised systems without needing to decrypt sensitive information, potentially guiding further forensic efforts.

## Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing:
Security professionals can use such a library to evaluate whether encryption implementations in custom applications or third-party software are up to snuff. It might check for things like weak key management practices or improper use of initialization vectors (IVs).

## Malware Analysis & Ransomware Detection:
In cases of ransomware or other malware, the library could help analysts identify the type of encryption used, spot common flaws, and even suggest potential weaknesses that might be exploited for data recovery (always in a controlled, legal context).

## Quality Assurance for Encryption Libraries:
Developers building encryption software or integrating encryption into their applications can use the library as a testing tool to verify that their implementations are robust. It can serve as an extra layer of validation to ensure that encryption is applied correctly across various modules.

## Research & Benchmarking:
Academics and security researchers could leverage the library to conduct experiments on encryption strength. They could compare various algorithms or study how different encryption flaws (like predictable IVs or lack of MACs) affect security, thereby contributing to the evolution of better cryptographic standards.

## Cloud & Data Storage Security:
Cloud service providers or backup solutions might integrate such a tool to automatically check that user data is properly encrypted before storage. It can act as a safeguard against misconfigurations that might leave sensitive data vulnerable.

## Automated Risk Management Tools:
Organizations that need to perform regular security checks can integrate this library into their risk management systems, continuously scanning files for encryption flaws and generating reports that drive timely security interventions.

## Cybersecurity Training & Education:
Educational platforms can use the library to demonstrate real-world examples of poor encryption practices. Students could experiment with various flawed encryptions and see firsthand how certain vulnerabilities (like using weak random number generators or improper padding schemes) compromise data security.

## Integration in File System Monitors:
File system security tools could use such a library to monitor for changes in encryption quality over time. If an update or patch accidentally downgrades encryption standards, the tool could trigger alerts, keeping systems consistently secure.

In summary, while the library won't decrypt files (which keeps it on the safe and legal side), its ability to evaluate encryption strength and identify common flaws makes it a valuable tool for anyone interested in strengthening data security, auditing existing systems, or simply learning more about cryptography. 

## As a result of thinking through the above i have decided like all my oter projects to make this completely open source and free even if it does have some security uses and impacts. ##
